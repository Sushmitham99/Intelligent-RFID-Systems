The project is about to maintain and routinely monitor the machinery and heavy instruments in use.

Mismanagement and a lack of concern for the upkeep of industrial equipment and heavy
gear could result in significant property damage and perhaps the death of workers in that
industry.
The project must have key features such as data retrieval, data storage, and reminders for
forthcoming maintenance, missed maintenance, and authorized management.
